# React Native Animated
This package is a collection of animated components as well as tools / utilities for creating animations in react native.

## Install

To install, use npm:

```
npm install react_native_animated --save
```

You will need react-native-svg to use this package but ideally in the future react native will have svg support removing the need for this dependency.

Use npm and react-native linking to install:

```
npm install react-native-svg --save
react-native link react-native-svg
```
